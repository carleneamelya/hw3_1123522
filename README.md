Question 1
<br>
Given an undirected graph with V nodes and E edges, create and return an adjacency list of the graph. 0-based indexing is followed everywhere.
<br><br>
Input:
<br>
V = 5, E = 7
<br>
edges = [[0,1], [0,4], [4,1], [4,3], [1,3], [1,2], [3,2]]
<br><br>
Output: 
[[1,4], [0,2,3,4], [1,3], [1,2,4], [0,1,3]]
<br><br>
Explanation:
<br>
Node 0 is connected to 1 and 4.
<br>
Node 1 is connected to 0,2,3 and 4.
<br>
Node 2 is connected to 1 and 3.
<br>
Node 3 is connected to 1,2 and 4.
<br>
Node 4 is connected to 0,1 and 3.
